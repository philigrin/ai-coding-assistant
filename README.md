Each `.md` file uses **YAML frontmatter** so that AI and IDE can read metadata. Check each file template for more details.

## ðŸ§  How to Use This with AI in IDE (Cursor, Windsurf)

- Open `task-xxx.md` â†’ AI reads frontmatter and knows:
  - tech stack
  - context of the activity/step/story/feature
  - input/output and requirements
- AI can access related files via links (used_in, related_to)
- This acts as documentation + context-driven code generation
